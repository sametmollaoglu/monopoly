  In this experiment, we were expected to implement an application which is the logic core
simulator of a simple board game. Main focus point of this experiment is to get us familiar
with polymorphism.

  There are two sides which are called Zorde and Calliance in this board game. Main theme of the game is
the war between two sides. Each side has 3 different types of characters. The game is played on a
board where each character occupies a cell on the board (just like chess). During the progress
of the game, each side makes moves in turns. The aim of the game is to kill every opponent
character.
